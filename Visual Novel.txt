music=06 Memory of the moment.wav



I walked down the school hallway towards my first period class.





There was no sound in the hallway, probably because the class already started.





I am always late because I am a heavy sleeper; you can't wake me up even if you drive a car through my 
bedroom, that's what my mother says.




The only person who could ever wake me up in the morning was my father.





Every morning, he would toss me out of my bed and kick the crap out of me until I open my eyes.





My mother and I called that parental abuse, but he would always say





"Man Up Quentyn. If you got time to laze around in your bed, then do something meaningful that will change your 
life"




Seven years ago, my father died in a car accident.





As much as he used to beat me, he was still a loving father, and his death shocked both me and my mother.





I fell into depression after that.





My grade in school fell, I slowly lost contact with my friends, and I became a robot that continued its
meaningless daily routine endlessly.




But one day after school, I saw a kid younger than me.





He was being bullied by a bunch of delinquent brats.





Seeing how defenseless the kid was, I intervened and saved the little kid.





Despite all the painful-looking bruises he got, he showed me the biggest smile that a person could ever muster
after getting so beat up, and he said




Little Kid:
Thank you mister.




Little Kid:
If it wasn't for you, they would have taken this away.




I looked at what the little kid was holding in his hand.





It was a pendant with the picture of a women.





He probably lost his mother, just like how I lost my father.





Little Kid:
Do you have someone important to you mister?




I was caught completely off guard by the question since it was the first time someone that, and of all the 
people who could have asked me, it was a little kid.




Little Kid:
My mother always said that even if I am alone, there are always someone who cares about me, just like how you
saved me today.



Living up until now, it still seems amazing to me how something a little kid says can affect me so much.





Sometimes, I just feel that he came from the future just to save me from my depression.





Why was I depressed for such a long time?





I still had my mother, who cared and loved me just as much as my father.





Just because my father was gone, it did't mean that I lost all meaning of my life.





As I walked towards my class,I looked out in the window.
background=morning.png




The sky was blue, and the sun casted its magnificent radiance on earth.





Although I was not someone who can appreciate the beauty of nature, I was mesmerized by the golden, brilliant 
scenery.




Is something amazing going to happen again today .............. ?

Sit down quickly. We are starting a lesson.




Quentyn:
Roger that.

Teacher:
Alright, as I mentioned, we are doing titration today.
 



Teacher:
You can work with one other person and both of you must complete the lab within this class. 




Teacher:
You may gather your materials and start working now.




The tranquility of the classroom was suddenly broken by the excited chatters. Each student walked around the 
room to find potential lab partners. Gradually, I was the only one left along with one other student who was 
sitting in a corner of the classroom.

Quentyn:
Yo, wanna work together on thi-




Quentyn:
Wait, what .......... what the heck?
quentyn=quentynSurprised.png



As the unfamiliar face turned towards me, I was completely set aback by the appearance of the girl who was in 
front me. 
music=nothing



She wore a mysterious pendant. Her silky cloth and her long hair that was tied by a ribbon gave off an aura 
of elegance and innocence.




But what contrasted most with her appearance were her eyes. They were as vast and deep as the ocean; you 
could lose yourself if you look into that space.




I was totally lost in my own fantasy until my teacher intervened.





Teacher:
Lothston, I forgot to mention this. She transferred to the school today, so she doesn't know much.....
music=05 Talk as usual.wav



Teacher:
So work with her on the lab and help her with anything she doesn't understand.




Quentyn:
Uhh .... I guess that's alright.




Teacher:
You're a great help Lothston. 




Teacher:
Anyways, enough with the chatter, you two may start your lab now.




slidelatia-600





Quentyn:
Well, we should get started. 
quentyn=quentynNormal.png



Quentyn:
By the way, my name is Quentyn, Quentyn Lothston. What is your name?




Transfer Girl:
........................




Transfer Girl:
........................




Quentyn:
Um, my name is Quentyn Lothston, do you mind telling me yours?




Transfer Girl:
........................




Quentyn:
Well, its ok if you don't want to answer, it is your first day in this new school after all. 




Quentyn:
let's do our best in this lab.




Quentyn:
For starters, could you get the chemical solution from the front counter?




Transfer Girl:
Go get it yourself.




Quentyn:
Um....this is a really easy job; you just have to go to the front counter and pour 100mL of those labeled 
solutions-



Transfer Girl:
I said, go get it yourself.




Quentyn:
Fine fine, I will get it.




Quentyn:
(Geez, what is up with this girl? First she doesn't give me her name and then she bosses me around like I'm 
her slave?)
quentyn=quentynFrustration.png


I reluctantly went to the front counter and obtained the solutions required for this experiment. 





By the time I came back to my lab station, the transfer girl had her arm crossed and wore an unpleasant 
expression on her face.




Transfer Girl:
You were slow like a pig.
latia=latiaIrritation.png



Quentyn:
Well, at least I got our materials. Lets get started!
quentyn=quentynNormal.png



I eagerly sucked in some of the clear liquid into the pipette. 





Just as I was about to eject the liquid into the solution that was given to us, the transfer girl suddenly 
seized my arm as if she was stopping me from committing a crime.




Transfer Girl:
What are you doing!? Are you trying to kill us all!?
latia=latiaAnger.png



Transfer Girl:
Don't you see that your solution is too concentrated?
 



Transfer Girl:
Go back to the counter and make a new solution, you moron.




Quentyn:
Hey, hold on a second!
quentyn=quentynAnger2.png



Quentyn:
You aren't even doing anything and you are telling me that I am doing this incorrectly?




Quentyn:
Just who do you think you are!?




Transfer Girl:
You think you are some kind of genius, Einstein?




Transfer Girl:
You were mixing hydrochloric acid with your beaker like you were some kind of stupid pyromaniac.




Transfer Girl:
If I hadn't stopped you, you would have demolished this classroom and everyone else along with it!




Transfer Girl:
I knew that you were stupid when I saw you, but I never knew that your head was this dense!




Quentyn:
So Ms. Intelligent knows how to do chemistry, big deal!




Quentyn:
I bet you don't have any friends because everyone else around you are so stupid.




Teacher:
THAT'S ENOUGH!

Silence. I will not hear any of your excuses. 
quentyn=quentynSerious.png



Teacher:
All I know is that you were disturbing the progress of my class by being unproductive and raising your voice 
in front of everyone.



Teacher:
As for you, transfer girl, I have no reason to not make you do the same thing this idiot will be doing after 
school. 



Teacher:
But knowing that you just transferred, I won't pursue further in this matter.




Teacher:
But if I find you being uncooperative again, you will be finding yourself in an unpleasant situation.

Quentyn:
But that girl honestly had some serious problem.

A Scream:
AHHH! SOMEBODY HELP!




As I was turning around, a desperate distant cry came from the other side of the hallway.
music=07 Death Striker6666.wav




Quentyn:
Somebody must be in trouble!
quentyn=quentynAnger1.pngs



slidequentyn-800





The cry continued as I ran, until when I finally reached the front of the door of a classroom where it seemed
like the source of the cry is the loudest.




I pushed open the door forcefully but what I saw in the classroom immediately made me feel unsafe.
background=eveningClass.png




A tall, dark figure was pinning a student on his neck against the wall.





He was nearly seven feet tall. He wore one of those 1800s-style English male dress covered by a cape which 
gave him the appearance of a rich vampire.




As the man gripped the boy's neck with more force, the boy's face contorted with agony from the lack of 
oxygen and the pain at his throat.




But even before he succumbed to that, the dark figure put his palm on the boy's head and pulled a silvery,
misty substance out of his body.




The boy's suffering intensified, and he let out a scream of pain that could have pierced hell.





When the man finished, he loosened the grip on the boy and the boy fell onto the floor, silent as a puppet.





slidequentyn550





Quentyn:
What the ........

quentyn=quentynSurprised.png


?????:
What do we have here?




The man turned his head towards the door and looked at me with those eyes of the demon.





?????:
HAHAHAHAHAHA! Another human!? Today is my lucky day!




Quentyn:
What......WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO HIM!?
quentyn=quentynAnger1.png



?????:
Him? Kukukukukuku...... You are about to find out boy.




The man approached me sinisterly and I backed off a few step. It looked like he was about to do something
terrible.




shake





In an instant, the man launched himself towards me like a missile.





Just like the other boy, he pinned me against the wall, and an omnious aura began to emit out of his right 
hand.




I desperately tried to free myself from his grasp but his left hand was too rigid.





In just a few seconds, my surrounding became blurry as I struggled for air.





?????:
Say good bye.




He raised his right hand and reached towards my face.





Right before I lost my consciousness, a flash of white light shot past the man's left arm.





The next moment, I fell onto the floor.





I gasped heavily for the few seconds of air that I lost.





The man immediately jumped back to the corner of a room and an unknown rage over took those demonic eyes.





?????:
WHO IS THERE!?




I looked around the room. It was the same as when I entered, but at the most right corner of my eye sight,
where there was nothing a moment ago, there now stood a girl.




She had long hair that was tied up, a mysterious pendant, and deep blue eyes.





Quentyn:
(It was the transfer girl that I met this morning!)




Quentyn:
(What in the name of god is she doing in this dangerous place!?)




She took a few steps toward us and looked at the motionless body that was lying on the floor


slidelatia-600


Transfer Girl:
Did you take away the soul of this student?




?????:
what if I did?




Quentyn:
(The soul of the student!? What the hell are they talking about!? Is this some kind of rehearsal for a
performance?)



Transfer Girl:
So this is how it has to be.......




The transfer girl reached out her hand into the air, and then, what looked like the shape of a sword began to
shape within her grasp.




She then pointed the bladeless sword towards the man.





Transfer Girl:
In the name of the Holy Twilight Council, I will eliminate you.




Quentyn:
(The holy what? Am I sure that I am not dreaming all this?)




?????:
Hmmmm.........So you are from the Council.




?????:
Are you another one of those third rate bounty hunters?




?????:
If you value your life, I recommend you to run away from me as fast as possible. No one who fought me
ever survived-



Without any hesitation, the transfer girl charged toward the man.





The girl slashed at him. He dodged the sword by ducking.





The man countered by extending his razor sharp nails toward the girl's heart.





But the girl saw through this. 





shake





She jumped and sumersaulted to the back of the man, and kicked him with such a strong force that sent him 
straight to the wall.




The man fell onto the floor, and there was a marking of a humanoid shape on the wall where he was slammed 
into.




I lost my speech as I gulped at the monstrous strength of this girl in front of me.





Quentyn:
How did you do that .........




The man stood up and balanced his body weakily.





?????:
How dare you ........




?????:
You made a big mistake girl.........you will regret ever challenging me!




The man swallowed the misty substance that he held for all this time and the darkness emitted by him suddenly
seemed to become stronger.




Transfer Girl:
Get out of this place now.




Quentyn:
Um........are you talking to me?




This is the first time she talked to me ever since she appeared in the room. I felt a little confused about
all the stuffs that just happened.




Transfer Girl:
That man is not human. You saw how he sucked the soul of that student.




Transfer Girl:
If you stay here any longer, I can't guarantee your safety.




Transfer Girl:
So leave this place at once, and never come back here again.




?????:
I am afraid that is not possible.




The man suddenly appeared behind me like he just teleported there.





I looked over my shoulder. The man surged his hand towards me like a snake.





effect=stab.wav





And then, there was the sound of ripping of the flesh.





The transfer girl stood in front of me like a shield, and she was holding something.





From the back of her hand protruded what looked like five really long nails.





Her hand bled heavily, but she was also holding onto the man's snake-like hand tightly enough to prevent it
from stabbing past even more.




Quentyn:
Hey! Your hand is hurt!




Transfer Girl:
Stop worrying about me, moron! Get out of here NOW!




Quentyn:
..................




Quentyn:
.......I'm sorry.




slidequentyn-700





I stood up and darted off, like a coward.





background=eveningHall.png
latiaX=-600




I was overwhelmed by guilt.





I was being protected by someone whom I barely know, and to top it all off, it was someone whom I previously 
hated.




She seriously damaged her hand to protect my life, and I could do nothing to help her, it was the worst kind 
of feeling.




Quentyn:
(Damn it! Why do I feel so useless.)




Quentyn:
(Maybe I should go back and help her out somehow? Besides, her hand was injured.)




Transfer Girl:
Flash Back(What are you doing!? Are you trying to kill us all!?)




Quentyn:
(Forget it, she didn't want me there.)




Quentyn:
(If I was there, then I would probably just be a dead weight for her.)




Transfer Girl:
Flash Back(You think you are some kind of genius, Einstein?)




Quentyn:
(But then again, she really pissed me off with what she said in class, she isn't that great or anything.)

dangerous, demonic force in the room.

I suppose even the elitest mage from the Councils is not as strong as a forbidden magic user.




?????:
But I must say, you are ten times the normal bounty hunters that I encountered! 




The transfer girl stood in the middle of the wrecked classroom.





She held onto the sword with only one hand, the other dangling from her arm from the damage it took.

I am sure your soul will be delicious!




Transfer Girl:
I see.....the soul stealing ability.....the overwhelming negative energy you are emitting.

But knowing who I am right before you are about to die is not too useful.

She could do nothing but watch as she witnesses her own future doom.

I sprayed the extinguisher at the man blindly in an attempt to meddle with his sight.





Draco:

It was working! I actually never expected it to work this well, especially against someone who looked as 
invincible as him.




Quentyn:
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE, TRANSFER GIRL!




Transfer Girl:
WATCH OUT!
latia=latiaAnger.png



From the corner of my eyes, I saw a familiar snake-like hand that was surging toward my body like a spear.





But this time, it was too close. I could not hope to dodge it at this distance. I closed my eyes to prepare
for the pain-




music=nothing
effect=stab.wav




And there was the sound of flesh ripping. But I felt no pain. I opened my eyes to look for what just happened.





I could see nothing but silky hairs in front of me. It smelled nice, but it was also accompanied by the stench of 
blood.




There stood the transfer girl. She stood in front of me like a shield, protruding from the right side of her back 
were five long nails.




The man pulled his hand out of the girl's body, and she collapsed onto the blood-bathed floor.





Quentyn:
HEY! GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!




Transfer Girl:
Why did you come back here?




She sounded weak, she was losing lots of blood from her wound.





Transfer Girl:
There is a limit to stupidity, you moron........




Quentyn:
WHY!? WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL HIM WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE!?




Transfer Girl:
Why? This is my mission.......I am supposed to defend the innocents, am I not?




Quentyn:
DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT!




Quentyn:
What happened to your cold attitude!? Why did you try to save someone worthless like me!?




Quentyn:
This is all my fault! If I didn't come back, then this wouldn't have happened to you!




Transfer Girl:
No, you idiot....




Transfer Girl:
I trained every day.......so I could become stronger........so that less people can die.




Transfer Girl:
If I can't save someone like you.....then how can I call myself a mage.




Transfer Girl:
But you came here to help me..........I am so pathetic, making a mere human worry about me.....




Quentyn:
HEY! GET YOURSELF TOGETHER!




The girl's voice progressively became weaker.





By now, the whole room is stenched by the smell of blood.





Transfer Girl:
By the way........you asked me for my name..........




Transfer Girl:
My name........is Latia........use this pendant....




I just noticed the white glow coming from her chest.





It came from the pendant she always wore, does this contain some kind of ultimate power?





The mysterious glow became brighter every second, and it started to engulf everything around it.





Draco:
What..!




glow





What is this light.





My body feels so light right now, its like there is no gravity.





I can't see my surroudings right now, so I think I am floating.





But I was at the classroom right now, how did I end up in this weird place?





Could all of this be just in my head?





A Voice:
Do you want strength.




Quentyn:
Yes! I want to save Latia!




A Voice:
Very well......

Draco:
SO DIE!




Like before, the man charged at me.





Quentyn:
REFLECT!
quentyn=quentynAnger1.png



I just spontaneously yelled out something without knowing its effect.





But immediately after that, the man was forced backwards like he just bounced against an invisible wall.





shake





The force of the bounce slammed him against the wall and clouds of dust fell from the ceiling due to the
impact.




Quentyn:
(What the hell was that!?)




The man stood up from the floor like a zombie. When you expected to look of surprise on his face, 
the side of his mouse curved upwards to form a deadly smirk.




Draco:
Kukuku......this is awesome.




Draco:
You are the first person to ever defend against my attack like that.




Draco:
A full-fledged mage....this is better than I have ever imagined!




Draco:
Instead of the girl's soul, I will take your soul instead!

Felled by my magic, the dark shape was consumed by flame.

explanation!

What happened yesterday was a complete accident.




Latia:
I am not sure of what happened there myself, but you were somehow able to perform magic.




Quentyn:
I.......performed magic?
quentyn=quentynSerious.png



Latia:
Yes. Only mages can perform magic, so what you did yesterday clearly indicates that you are a mage.




Quentyn:
Hey! That is impossible! I've been living normally like everyone else since I was born!

Quentyn:
Then my mom........is she a mage too?




Latia:
She is.




All the information Latia threw at me just now sounded like something straight out of a fantasy game.





But instead of being confused and scared, my body trembled with excitment.





Latia:
Look, I am on a top secret and dangerous mission, so stop involving yourself with me anymore.

Latia:
For all I know, he could have been hunting for treasure underneath the school building or something.




Latia:
But what I do know for sure is that there are more of them hiding in this school.




Latia:
The amount of magic energy that I detected when I first came to this school hasn't subsided yet......




Latia:
In other words, if you don't want to die, stop associating yourself with me.




Latia:
I don't need a dead weight like you pulling me down every time.

Latia looked at me with a surprised look. She tried to open her mouth to say something, but nothing came out.
latia=latiaNormal.png




Quentyn:
Look, these guys are killing students and I bet that this wasn't even the first time it happened.




Quentyn:
Whatever these guys have on their agenda, I can't forgive them for what they did!




Quentyn:
So if you are going to take on these guys, then you got to count me in!




Latia:
You still don't understand the situation you are in!
latia=latiaAnger.png



Latia:
Stop playing the hero like you are in a video game you idiot!




Latia:
Next time, you won't get away with just a ripped up hand or a torn up body, but you could very well lose your
life!



Quentyn:
Then LET them tear up my hand or body! At least it is better than fighting alone by myself!
latia=latiaNormal.png



Latia:
..............I don't understand you at all.




Latia:
Why....why does a normal human like you go so far just to help me?




Quentyn:
Because I really like you, Latia!




Quentyn:
You saved me twice yesterday, and in both times, you hurt yourself trying to protect me.




Quentyn:
BUt even though you were hurt, you still continued to fight, and I really admire that!




Quentyn:
The next time you are in danger, I want to be the person to protect you!




Latia's face suddenly became apple red from my last few lines. She turned around to hide her face from me.
Did I say something?




Latia:
Do whatever you want, just don't get in my way the next time we fight.




Quentyn:
YES! THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME IN ON THIS!




?????:
So you want to protect her eh, Quentyn Lothston?

Out of no where, a mysterious man approached us from the sidewalk.





From the way he talked, he seemed like he was looking for trouble.





Chronos:
My name is Chronos.




Chronos:
I am here to congratulate you on destroying Draco Leung, especially you, Quentyn.




Quentyn:
What? Me?
quentyn=quentynSurprised.png



Latia:
Don't go along with him you idiot! He is trying to trick you!
latia=latiaAnger.png



Chronos:
I heard that there was a boisterous girl who is with Quentyn, but who would have thought that it was Latia of
the Twilight Princess!



At the mention of her name, Latia's hands clenched into a fist.





Chronos:
You really are as belligerent as everyone says!




Chronos:
Unfortunately for you, I am not here to start a war.




Chronos:
But rather, I am here to make a deal with you.




Latia:
Do you know the absurdity of what you just said? How do you expect us to believe your words after yesterday's
incident?



Latia:
If we don't like what you are about to say, we can take you down right here and now.




Chronos:
Frankly, I feel that resorting to violence to solve problems is childish and I had expected more civil
behaviour from a mage of the Twilight Councils.



Chronos:
Why not just let us talk things through and plan the best course of action for both parties?




Chronos:
At least Quentyn would like to hear the deal, wouldn't you, Quentyn?




Quentyn:
Latia, let's just listen to what he has to say, we can deal with him later.
quentyn=quentynSerious.png



Latia:
Grrrrr.......fine....
latia=latiaIrritation.png



Chronos:
Very well met, Quentyn Lothston.




Chronos:
My deal is as follows:




Chronos:
You two shall work for my faction, and we will not bother this school ever again.




Quentyn:
SO YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING IN THIS SCHOOL! HOW DARE YOU BASTARDS-




Chronos:
I am not done talking yet Quentyn, I suggest you to keep your cool and listen to the rest of my story.




Chronos:
As you have sensed, this is not a normal school.




Chronos:
There are many other places in the world where mages live secretly with humans, but this place has the 
highest magical energy density ever seen.



Chronos:
My faction has already discovered the artifact that controls this source of energy, the Ring of Solomon.




Latia:
Impossible! The Twilight Council destroyed that ring centuries ago!
latia=latiaAnger.png



Chronos:
That was what you were taught.




Chronos:
But before it was destroyed, the Twilight Councils attempted to extract the power contained in the ring.




Chronos:
They set up a laboratory at a remote location, but one day, their experiment backfired.




Chronos:
The laboratory and everyone in the laboratory were obliterated.




Chronos:
Every document and sources regarding the existence of the ring also disappeared.




Chronos:
But few months ago, my colleague uncovered the artifact at the deepest chamber of the school building.




Chronos:
She and I are currently trying to remove all the enchantments that are surrounding the ring.




Chronos:
With your helps, we can accelerate the speed of our work and gain access to the power of the ring.




At the end of his speech, my head was clouded with question marks.





However, Latia was completely dumbfounded by what Chronos just said.





For someone who is the princess of whatever, and someone who knows so much about magic, she just looked at 
Chronos with eyes of complete disbelief.




Latia:
This is impossible........
latia=latiaNormal.png



Chronos:
As unbelievable as it sounds, we are the only ones in the whole world who knows about this.




Chronos:
If you help us and complete our work, we will share a reasonable amount of energy that we can acquire.




Chronos:
Simple enough, don't you think?




I could feel the immense pressure surrounding Latia. She looked like she was being hammered down by the
heavy choice that she was about to make.




Latia:
Ok..I shall help you-




Quentyn:
STOP THIS NONSENSE!
quentyn=quentynAnger2.png



Latia:
what....!
latia=latiaNormal.png



Quentyn:
At first, I thought this Chronos guy was gonna make some kind of reasonable trade.




Quentyn:
But I stand here listening to you speak and what do I hear?!




Quentyn:
You can't let this creepy son of a bitch carry you along with his horrible little speech!




Latia:
But if we help him, he would leave the school alone and I would be able to finish my mention!




Quentyn:
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?




Quentyn:
What is this guy going to do after we finish unlocking this ring? 




Quentyn:
Do you think someone creepy like him is going to save the world from starvation or something after getting 
this power? HELLZ NO!



Quentyn:
There is no reason to hesitate over this even for a second!




Quentyn:
We will never take orders from this bastard spouting such patently ridiculous nonsense!




Latia:
Quentyn.........




Latia:
Hm, I can't believe I am getting lectured by an idiot like him....




Latia:
You heard him, Chronos, we will not help you in uncovering the Ring.




Chronos:
Hmmmm, I see.




Chronos:
So you are that kind of person, unlike a certain someone I know.




Chronos:
Very well, just in case this plan failed, I prepared a plan B.




Quentyn:
Plan B?
quentyn=quentynSurprised.png



Chronos:
Behold!




With his last word, the pavement of the entire roof glowed with a blinding light.

As the light intensified, the shapes around me slowly became blocked by the glow.





Quentyn:

When the light receded, the only shape that I could find in the whole roof top was Chronos.

Chronos:
I just sent her to my colleague's location.




Chronos:
I am sure that my colleague will take good care of Latia.




Quentyn:
WHY YOU!




Chronos:
Now, I am done negotiating with you. Allow me to return to my colleague.




Quentyn:
HEY WAIT! You are not leaving this place until you tell me where you sent Latia!




Chronos:
Oh? What if I don't?




Quentyn:
Then I will clobber you into the ground!




Chronos:
Hahaha, such rash words, it seems like I won't be able to get away peacefully....




Chronos:
Very well, I shall take you on, and once I am done, I will use you as a sacrifice for uncovering the artifact.

Chronos:
I see, there is no surprise that you defeated Draco.




Chronos:
But I am curious as to what could have given you such powerful strength.




Chronos:
Perhaps the danger of your friend brough out some form of latent strength in you?




Quentyn:
STOP MESSING WITH ME! WHERE IS LATIA!?




Chronos:
You are a hot-headed one aren't you?




Chronos:
Unforunately for you, I have a plan C in case this failed.




Chronos:

The entire roof top was once again engulfed by the blinding light.





Chronos:
We shall meet again, Quentyn Lothston.

Just like before, when the light finally receded, Chronos was no where to be seen.

Latia:
Where is this place.............
latia=latiaIrritation.png



Latia found herself in a mysterious space.





Dark as night, and vast as the ocean, the space was like a different dimension all together.





Her surrouding was blurry and misty, but she could make out several large pillars.





However, there was one pillar that caught her attention.





It was the biggest and the thickest pillar of all, and the tip of the pillar shined light that was fiery
benevolent as the sun itself.




Latia:
Could that be........




?????:
The Ring of Solomon, the granter of wish.




Latia:
Who's there!?
latia=latiaAnger.png



?????:
I am Keeper of the Soul, Masaeiv.
latia=latiaNormal.png



Wearing a ritually decorated robe and hiding underneath and behind a hood and a white mask, a figure appeared
behind Latia.




Masaeiv:
This is an alternate dimension where the dead souls gather, and it is a place where those souls unite as one
at the top of that pillar.



Latia looked at the mysterious masked figure, then at the source of light. The searing light luminated
endlessly.




Masaeiv:
Ring of Solomon calls forth all beings with a desire, living or non-living.




Masaeiv:
Once it is obtained, its master can be granted one of his wish.




Masaeiv:
For thousands of years, the Ring of Solomon was sought after by treasure hunters, mages, and the wealthy.




Masaeiv:
One or more people died each time it changed its owner, and each of the dead souls who has sought after the
ring are gathered in this dimension to unite at the ring.



With the mention of the soul, Latia noticed and could feel the spirit particles that are flowing past her 
body like water in stream.




Latia:
Then why am I here?




Latia:
I am not dead, and I have certainly never even knew that the Ring of Solomon existed.




Masaeiv:
To reawaken the power of the ring, a sacrifice of a strong soul is needed.




Masaeiv:
You are called here because the deity living within the ring deems you as a suitable sacrifice.




Latia:
Don't screw with me you witch! Just what right do you have of taking other people's lives for your own gain!
latia=latiaAnger.png



Masaeiv:
Being the sacrifice of Great Solomon is not a right, it is a privilege. Deem yourself honoured for even
being selected.



Latia:
What if I don't obey? What are you gonna do about it?




Masaeiv:
Kukukuku, there is no need for me to do anything, the Great Solomon will judge you.




Confused at what the figure just said, Latia looked at the tip of the tall pillar once again.





Something was different this time. The spherical orb of light started to emit waves of magical energy in 
all direction like the pulsating of the heart.




The sphere grew bigger with each pulse and Latia sensed danger in whatever that thing was
becoming.




But Latia sensed something else.





Chronos appeared from the mist. He seemed a little dissatisfied.





Chronos:
I have returned.




Masaeiv:
Excellent.




Masaeiv:
Before you are sacrificed, I shall show you a demonstration of the power of the Great Solomon.




Latia:
What...
latia=latiaIrritation.png



Looking at the confused Chronos, Masaeiv slowly raised her arm towards him.





Masaeiv then formed a forceful palm against Chronos, and suddenly, his body was thrown back like a stone to the
bottom of the tallest pillar.




Chronos:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MASAEIV!?




Masaeiv:
Now you shall witness the ritual.




High above Chronos, the sphere of energy stopped pulsating. 





A whip-like bundles of energy extended from the ring and pierced through Chronos' head at a blinding speed.





Kneeling in front of the pillar, Chronos silently stared at the source of the light.





Like a mosquito sucking the blood out of its victim, the ring absorbed Chronos' soul through the bundle of
energy.




Once it was finished, the whip was pulled back, and Chronos collapsed on the floor.





Latia:
What the hell........




Masaeiv:
As you saw, the Ring of Solomon is not just an artifact, but it is also an entity, a divine entity that requires
soul sacrifices.



Masaeiv:
The next sacrifice shall be you, so make your time........

Quentyn:
Now, where could the entrance be......
quentyn=quentynSerious.png



Quentyn:
I am sure that Chronos said that it was located in the deepest part of the school....




Quentyn:
Even though he said it was here, there are nothing other than dusts and bugs, not to mention that there is no
light.



Quentyn:
Maybe Chronos lied to us-




Quentyn:
Ouch!




When I could not see anything in front of me, my head came into contact with a solid surface.





Confused at what I have just encountered, I knocked on the invisible surface in front of me, and I could clearly
hear the sound of my hand hitting the wall.




Quentyn:
This is weird......maybe magic will work.




effect=magic.wav





I casted a weak destructive spell upon the invisible wall, but it only showed a little crack and ray of blue
light came shined on the darkness from the slit that was created.




Quentyn:
So this is not enough huh? Lemme try this.




effect=magic.wav





I casted another spell, but this time it was stronger than the last, and it created more cracks on the invisible
wall.




I continued to cast spells on the wall, until finally when the entire surface of the wall was filled with slits.





To finish it off, I casted my most destructive spell on the wall, and the wall shattered like a mirror.





glow





background=eternalGarden.png
quentynX=-600
dim



But what awaited me on the other side of the wall was completely unexpected.





Like standing at the entrance of a dark cave, I was looking at a misty, vast horizon of space.





Quentyn:
There is a huge space underneath the school building!




Despite the mist, I could make out some large pillars and two blurry shapes in the space.





I walked closer to the shapes to see what or who they are.





From the distance that I was in, I could sort of make out that they were at least five meters away.





There was one who were wearing a robe, but I couldn't see what was under the hood.





On the other hand, the slightly shorter figure was looking at something in the sky.





She looked at the sky so intently, as if she just saw a UFO for the first time in her life.





Quentyn:
Latia!

Latia:
Alright!
latia=latiaIrritation.png



When I turned around to look for the place where I came in from, I saw nothing but floating mist.





Quentyn:
The entrance disappeared.




Masaeiv:
Unforunately, you can no longer leave this place.




Masaeiv:
The girl's soul must be given to the Ring of Solomon to finalize the awakening of the deity.




Masaeiv:
As long as the girl's soul is not given to the ring, we are stranded in this dimension forever.




Quentyn:
That is total bullshit!
quentyn=quentynAnger2.png



Quentyn:
THere must be some other way!




Masaeiv:
There is no other way, if we do not sacrifice her now, all of us would be sucked into the ring.




In a rage, I charged at the hooded figure and aimed a fist straight at its face.





However, my punch was completely blocked by some kind of invisible barrier, like the one I encountered in the
dark basement.




Masaeiv:
So you will not listen to reason.




Masaeiv:
Then I shall make you listen to reason, by force.......




battle4





With my last punch, I broke through the invisible barrier, and it connected with Masaeiv's mask.





The mask broke down and it revealed the hidden face underneath the hood.





Quentyn:
No.......
quentyn=quentynSerious.png



Behind the mask was the face of a women who Quentyn knew for Seventeen years.





Quentyn:
Mom! What are you doing here!?

music=06 Memory of the moment.wav


Dianna:
I am sorry that you had to go through this Quentyn, but I did this for you Quentyn.




Quentyn:
Which part of any of this did I even ask for! You were just trying to sacrifice Latia for that stupid ring!




Dianna:
You don't understand Quentyn.




Dianna:
I am doing this because I want you to live happily!




Quentyn:
What....




Dianna:
Your father, I was the one who killed him.




Quentyn:
Bull Crap! We both know that he died in a car accident!




Dianna:
I was the one who covered up the fact. I killed him with my own hands using magic.




Quentyn:
No, that is not true.........




Dianna:
When your father and I married, he never knew that I was a mage.




Dianna:
I kept a secret from him and because I kept that secret, our lives were peaceful.




Dianna:
But you started to become older, your mage blood started to come into effect.




Dianna:
Your father initially ignored the strange incidents, but it just slowly became more chaotic and uncontrollable.




Dianna:
So one day, I told him that I was a mage and you were one too.




Dianna:
I thought he would forgive me for keeping the secret from him, but he became.......he tried to kill both of us.




Dianna:
When he was like that, I could only use magic to stop him, and I accidentally killed him.




Tears welled up in my mothers eyes. It took every ounce of her courage to revisit her terrible past.





Dianna:
Look Quentyn, if we use the Ring of Solomon, you can live peacefully in the human world.




Dianna:
In fact, the magic world can coexist with the human world once our wish is granted by the ring.




Quentyn:
How could you think like that mom.....




Quentyn:
How could you ever hope to make the magic world to blend in with the human world!




Quentyn:
Even if they did coexist, mages will take advantage of the human, and peace between the two races will be
destroyed!



Dianna:
Quentyn......

That is impossible. That thing won't rest until it eats a soul!

Latia continued to run until she reached approximately fifty meters away from the ring.





The pendant glowed magically.





The glow was so brilliant that it matched the glow of the ring.





Finishing her chanting, Latia drew a sword out of thin air that was blazing with blue flame. 





I could see the condensed energy flowing into her weapon; the blade grew bigger the more energy it absorbed from
the pendant.




This was Latia's ultimate magic, her most powerful and dangerous weapon.

can never be enchanted by those eyes because they just stare into you and make you feel like you are a total
idiot.
